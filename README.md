## Overview

The **Blog Post Generator** is a streamlined tool designed to create tailored content simultaneously for LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter), and simple blog posts on the same topic. Using the power of Google Sheets and the OpenAI API, this project simplifies content creation by generating platform-optimized posts with just a few inputs.

This project is a work-in-progress, with future plans to connect to a database for enhanced functionality and data management.

## Features

- **Multi-Platform Content Generation**: Generates platform-specific posts for LinkedIn, X, and blogs simultaneously.
- **Google Sheets Integration**: Easily input topics, adjust parameters, and manage content generation directly in a Google Sheet.
- **AI-Powered Writing**: Utilizes OpenAI API to generate professional, engaging, and tailored content.
- **Customizable Topics**: Focus on a single topic, and the tool adapts the tone and structure for each platform.

## How It Works

1. **Input Topics**: Use Google Sheets to input your topic or idea.
2. **Content Generation**: The OpenAI API processes the input and generates optimized posts for LinkedIn, X, and a blog.
3. **Output Review**: The results are displayed in Google Sheets, where you can review and make adjustments as needed.
4. **Future Plans**: Plans to connect the generator to a database for improved storage, retrieval, and analytics.
